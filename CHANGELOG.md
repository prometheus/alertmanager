### Removal of API v1

The Alertmanager `v1` API has been deprecated since January 2019 with the release of Alertmanager `v0.16.0`. With the release of version `0.27.0` it is now removed.
A successful HTTP request to any of the `v1` endpoints will log and return a deprecation message while responding with a status code of `410`.
Please ensure you switch to the `v2` equivalent endpoint in your integrations before upgrading.

### Alertmanager support for all UTF-8 characters in matchers and label names

Starting with Alertmanager `v0.27.0`, we have a new parser for matchers that has a number of backwards incompatible changes. While most matchers will be forward-compatible, some will not. Alertmanager is operating a transition period where it supports both UTF-8 and classic matchers, so **it's entirely safe to upgrade without any additional configuration**. With that said, we recommend the following:

- If this is a new Alertmanager installation, we recommend enabling UTF-8 strict mode before creating an Alertmanager configuration file. You can enable strict mode with `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature="utf8-strict-mode"`.

- If this is an existing Alertmanager installation, we recommend running the Alertmanager in the default mode called fallback mode before enabling UTF-8 strict mode. In this mode, Alertmanager will log a warning if you need to make any changes to your configuration file before UTF-8 strict mode can be enabled. **Alertmanager will make UTF-8 strict mode the default in the next two versions**, so it's important to transition as soon as possible.

Irrespective of whether an Alertmanager installation is a new or existing installation, you can also use `amtool` to validate that an Alertmanager configuration file is compatible with UTF-8 strict mode before enabling it in Alertmanager server by running `amtool check-config config.yml` and inspecting the log messages.

Should you encounter any problems, you can run the Alertmanager with just the classic parser enabled by running `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature="classic-mode"`. If so, please submit a bug report via GitHub issues.

## 0.17.0 / 2019-05-02

This release includes changes to amtool which are not fully backwards
compatible with the previous amtool version (#1798) related to backup and
import of silences. If a backup of silences is created using a previous
version of amtool (v0.16.1 or earlier), it is possible that not all silences
can be correctly imported using a later version of amtool.

Additionally, the groups endpoint that was dropped from api v1 has been added
to api v2. The default for viewing alerts in the UI now consumes from this
endpoint and displays alerts grouped according to the groups defined in the
running configuration. Custom grouping is still supported.

This release has added two new flags that may need to be tweaked. For people
running with a lot of concurrent requests, consider increasing the value of
`--web.get-concurrency`. An increase in 503 errors indicates that the request
rate is exceeding the number of currently available workers. The other new
flag, --web.timeout, limits the time a request is allowed to run. The default
behavior is to not use a timeout.
