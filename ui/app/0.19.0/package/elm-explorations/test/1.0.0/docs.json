If you are doing both, you want both kinds of tolerance,\nor to split the calculation into smaller parts for testing.\n\n\n### Absolute Tolerance\n\nLet's say we want to figure out if our estimation of pi is precise enough.\n\nIs `3.14` within `0.01` of `pi`? Yes, because `3.13 < pi < 3.15`.\n\n    test \"3.14 approximates pi with absolute precision\" <| \\_ ->\n        3.14 |> Expect.within (Absolute 0.01) pi\n\n\n### Relative Tolerance\n\nWhat if we also want to know if our circle circumference estimation is close enough?\n\nLet's say our circle has a radius of `r` meters. The formula for circle circumference is `C=2*r*pi`.\nTo make the calculations a bit easier ([ahem](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto)), we'll look at half the circumference; `C/2=r*pi`.\nIs `r * 3.14` within `0.01` of `r * pi`?\nThat depends, what does `r` equal? If `r` is `0.01`mm, or `0.00001` meters, we're comparing\n`0.00001 * 3.14 - 0.01 < r * pi < 0.00001 * 3.14 + 0.01` or `-0.0099686 < 0.0000314159 < 0.0100314`.\nThat's a huge tolerance! A circumference that is _a thousand times longer_ than we expected would pass that test!\n\nOn the other hand, if `r` is very large, we're going to need many more digits of pi.\nFor an absolute tolerance of `0.01` and a pi estimation of `3.14`, this expectation only passes if `r < 2*pi`.\n\nIf we use a relative tolerance of `0.01` instead, the circle area comparison becomes much better. Is `r * 3.14` within\n`1%` of `r * pi`? Yes! In fact, three digits of pi approximation is always good enough for a 0.1% relative tolerance,\nas long as `r` isn't [too close to zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number).\n\n    fuzz\n        (floatRange 0.000001 100000)\n        \"Circle half-circumference with relative tolerance\"\n        (\\r -> r * 3.14 |> Expect.within (Relative 0.001) (r * pi))\n\n\n### Trouble with Numbers Near Zero\n\nIf you are adding things near zero, you probably want absolute tolerance. If you're comparing values between `-1` and `1`, you should consider using absolute tolerance.\n\nFor example: Is `1 + 2 - 3` within `1%` of `0`? Well, if `1`, `2` and `3` have any amount of rounding error, you might not get exactly zero. What is `1%` above and below `0`? Zero. We just lost all tolerance. Even if we hard-code the numbers, we might not get exactly zero; `0.1 + 0.2` rounds to a value just above `0.3`, since computers, counting in binary, cannot write down any of those three numbers using a finite number of digits, just like we cannot write `0.333...` exactly in base 10.\n\nAnother example is comparing values that are on either side of zero. `0.0001` is more than `100%` away from `-0.0001`. In fact, `infinity` is closer to `0.0001` than `0.0001` is to `-0.0001`, if you are using a relative tolerance. Twice as close, actually. So even though both `0.0001` and `-0.0001` could be considered very close to zero, they are very far apart relative to each other. The same argument applies for any number of zeroes.\n\n","unions":[{"name":"FloatingPointTolerance","comment":" A type to describe how close a floating point number must be to the expected value for the test to pass.
