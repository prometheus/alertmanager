                "comment": " All links in an [`application`](#application) create a `UrlRequest`. So\nwhen you click `<a href=\"/home\">Home</a>`, it does not just navigate! It\nnotifies `onUrlRequest` that the user wants to change the `Url`.\n\n### `Internal` vs `External`\n\nImagine we are browsing `https://example.com`. An `Internal` link would be\nlike:\n\n- `settings#privacy`\n- `/home`\n- `https://example.com/home`\n- `//example.com/home`\n\nAll of these links exist under the `https://example.com` domain. An `External`\nlink would be like:\n\n- `https://elm-lang.org/examples`\n- `https://other.example.com/home`\n- `http://example.com/home`\n\nAnything that changes the domain. Notice that changing the protocol from\n`https` to `http` is considered a different domain! (And vice versa!)\n\n### Purpose\n\nHaving a `UrlRequest` requires a case in your `update` like this:\n\n    import Browser exposing (..)\n    import Browser.Navigation as Nav\n    import Url\n\n    type Msg = ClickedLink UrlRequest\n\n    update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd msg)\n    update msg model =\n      case msg of\n        ClickedLink urlRequest ->\n          case urlRequest of\n            Internal url ->\n              ( model\n              , Nav.pushUrl model.key (Url.toString url)\n              )\n\n            External url ->\n              ( model\n              , Nav.load url\n              )\n\nThis is useful because it gives you a chance to customize the behavior in each\ncase. Maybe on some `Internal` links you save the scroll position with\n[`Browser.Dom.getViewport`](Browser-Dom#getViewport) so you can restore it\nlater. Maybe on `External` links you persist parts of the `Model` on your\nservers before leaving. Whatever you need to do!\n\n**Note:** Knowing the scroll position is not enough restore it! What if the\nbrowser dimensions change? The scroll position will not correlate with\n&ldquo;what was on screen&rdquo; anymore. So it may be better to remember\n&ldquo;what was on screen&rdquo; and recreate the position based on that. For\nexample, in a Wikipedia article, remember the header that they were looking at\nmost recently. [`Browser.Dom.getElement`](Browser-Dom#getElement) is designed\nfor figuring that out!\n",

It covers:\n\n- Focus and blur input elements.\n- Get the `width` and `height` of elements.\n- Get the `x` and `y` coordinates of elements.\n- Figure out the scroll position.\n- Change the scroll position!\n\nWe use different terminology than JavaScript though...\n\n\n# Terminology\n\nHave you ever thought about how &ldquo;scrolling&rdquo; is a metaphor about\nscrolls? Like hanging scrolls of caligraphy made during the Han Dynasty\nin China?\n\nThis metaphor falls apart almost immediately though. For example, many scrolls\nread horizontally! Like a [Sefer Torah][torah] or [Chinese Handscrolls][hand].\nThe two sides move independently, sometimes kept in place with stones. What is\na scroll bar in this world? And [hanging scrolls][hang] (which _are_ displayed\nvertically) do not &ldquo;scroll&rdquo; at all! They hang!\n\nSo in JavaScript, we start with a badly stretched metaphor and add a bunch of\nDOM details like padding, borders, and margins. How do those relate to scrolls?\nFor example, JavaScript has `clientWidth`. Client like a feudal state that pays\ntribute to the emperor? And `offsetHeight`. Can an offset even have height? And\nwhat has that got to do with scrolls?\n\nSo instead of inheriting this metaphorical hodge-podge, we use terminology from\n3D graphics. You have a **scene** containing all your elements and a **viewport**\ninto the scene. I think it ends up being a lot clearer, but you can evaluate\nfor yourself when you see the diagrams later!\n\n**Note:** For more scroll facts, I recommend [A Day on the Grand Canal with\nthe Emperor of China or: Surface Is Illusion But So Is Depth][doc] where David\nHockney explores the history of _perspective_ in art.

Request a new HTML document. The page goes blank.\n  2. As the HTML loads, request any `<script>` or `<link>` resources.\n  3. A `<script>` may mutate the document, so these tags block rendering.\n  4. When *all* of the assets are loaded, actually render the page.\n\nThat means the page will go blank for at least two round-trips to the servers!\nYou may have 90% of the data you need and be blocked on a font that is taking\na long time. Still blank!\n\n\n## How does `pushUrl` help?\n\nThe `pushUrl` function changes the URL, but lets you keep the current HTML.\nThis means the page *never* goes blank. Instead of making two round-trips to\nthe server, you load whatever assets you want from within Elm. Maybe you do\nnot need any round-trips!
