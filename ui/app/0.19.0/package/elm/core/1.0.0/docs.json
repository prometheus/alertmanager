The `number` type variable means this operation can be\nspecialized to `Int -> Int -> Int` or to `Float -> Float -> Float`. So you\ncan do things like this:\n\n    3002 + 4004 == 7006  -- all ints\n    3.14 + 3.14 == 6.28  -- all floats\n\nYou _cannot_ add an `Int` and a `Float` directly though. Use functions like\n[toFloat](#toFloat) or [round](#round) to convert both values to the same type.\nSo if you needed to add a list length to a `Float` for some reason, you\ncould say one of these:\n\n    3.14 + toFloat (List.length [1,2,3]) == 6.14\n    round 3.14 + List.length [1,2,3]     == 6\n\n**Note:** Languages like Java and JavaScript automatically convert `Int` values\nto `Float` values when you mix and match. This can make it difficult to be sure\nexactly what type of number you are dealing with. When you try to _infer_ these\nconversions (as Scala does) it can be even more confusing. Elm has opted for a\ndesign that makes all conversions explicit.\n","type":"number -> number -> number","associativity":"left","precedence":6},{"name":"++","comment":" Put two appendable things together.
