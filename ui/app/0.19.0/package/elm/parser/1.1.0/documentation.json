This can be pretty annoying in long files.\n\nLanguages like Elm allow you to nest multi-line comments, but your parser needs\nto be a bit fancier to handle this. After you start a comment, you have to\ndetect if there is another one inside it! And then you have to make sure all\nthe `{-` and `-}` match up properly!

So if I wanted the `^^^^`\nunderline like in Elm, I would find the `row` in the source code and do\nsomething like this:\n\n    makeUnderline : String -> Int -> Int -> String\n    makeUnderline row minCol maxCol =\n      String.toList row\n        |> List.indexedMap (toUnderlineChar minCol maxCol)\n        |> String.fromList\n\n    toUnderlineChar : Int -> Int -> Int -> Char -> Char\n    toUnderlineChar minCol maxCol col char =\n      if minCol <= col && col <= maxCol then\n        '^'\n      else if char == '\\t' then\n        '\\t'\n      else\n        ' '\n\nSo it would preserve any tabs from the source line.

For example, here\nis a rough outline of some code that uses `inContext` to mark when you are\nparsing a specific definition:\n\n    import Char\n    import Parser.Advanced exposing (..)\n    import Set\n\n    type Context\n      = Definition String\n      | List\n\n    definition : Parser Context Problem Expr\n    definition =\n      functionName\n        |> andThen definitionBody\n\n    definitionBody : String -> Parser Context Problem Expr\n    definitionBody name =\n      inContext (Definition name) <|\n        succeed (Function name)\n          |= arguments\n          |. symbol (Token \"=\" ExpectingEquals)\n          |= expression\n\n    functionName : Parser c Problem String\n    functionName =\n      variable\n        { start = Char.isLower\n        , inner = Char.isAlphaNum\n        , reserved = Set.fromList [\"let\",\"in\"]\n        , expecting = ExpectingFunctionName\n        }\n\nFirst we parse the function name, and then we parse the rest of the definition.\nImportantly, we call `inContext` so that any dead end that occurs in\n`definitionBody` will get this extra context information. That way you can say\nthings like, “I was expecting an equals sign in the `view` definition.” Context!\n",
