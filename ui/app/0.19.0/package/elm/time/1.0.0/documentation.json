It cannot give you `Europe/Stockholm`, `Asia/Tokyo`, or any other\nnormal time zone from the [full list][tz] due to limitations in JavaScript.\nFor example, if you run `here` in New York City, the resulting `Zone` will\nnever be `America/New_York`. Instead you get `Etc/GMT-5` or `Etc/GMT-4`\ndepending on Daylight Saving Time. So even though browsers must have internal\naccess to `America/New_York` to figure out that offset, there is no public API\nto get the full information. This means the `Zone` you get from this function\nwill act weird if (1) an application stays open across a Daylight Saving Time\nboundary or (2) you try to use it on historical data.\n\n**Future Note:** We can improve `here` when there is good browser support for\nJavaScript functions that (1) expose the IANA time zone database and (2) let\nyou ask the time zone of the computer. The committee that reviews additions to\nJavaScript is called TC39, and I encourage you to push for these capabilities!
