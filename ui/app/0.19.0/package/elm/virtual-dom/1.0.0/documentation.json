So the `class`\n     in `<div class=\"greeting\"></div>` is called an *attribute*.\n\n  2. Properties &mdash; You can also set things in JS. So the `className`\n     in `div.className = 'greeting'` is called a *property*.\n\nSo the `class` attribute corresponds to the `className` property. At first\nglance, perhaps this distinction is defensible, but it gets much crazier.\n*There is not always a one-to-one mapping between attributes and properties!*\nYes, that is a true fact. Sometimes an attribute exists, but there is no\ncorresponding property. Sometimes changing an attribute does not change the\nunderlying property. For example, as of this writing, the `webkit-playsinline`\nattribute can be used in HTML, but there is no corresponding property!\n",

                "comment": " When using `on` you can customize the event behavior\na bit. There are two ways to do this:\n\n  - [`stopPropagation`][sp] means the event stops traveling through the DOM.\n  So if propagation of a click is stopped, it will not trigger any other event\n  listeners.\n\n  - [`preventDefault`][pd] means any built-in browser behavior related to the\n  event is prevented. This can be handy with key presses or touch gestures.\n\n**Note 1:** A [passive][] event listener will be created if you use `Normal`\nor `MayStopPropagation`. In both cases `preventDefault` cannot be used, so\nwe can enable optimizations for touch, scroll, and wheel events in some\nbrowsers.\n\n**Note 2:** Some actions, like uploading and downloading files, are only\nallowed when the JavaScript event loop is running because of user input. This\nis for security! So when an event occurs, we call `update` and send any `port`\nmessages immediately, all within the same tick of the event loop. This makes\nit possible to handle user-instigated events in ports.\n\n**Note 3:** Normally the `view` is shown in the next `requestAnimationFrame`\ncall. This allows us to save some work if messages are coming in very quickly.\nBut if `stopPropagation` is used, we update the DOM immediately, within the\nsame tick of the event loop. This is useful for DOM nodes that hold their own\nstate, like `<input type=\"text\">`. If someone types very fast, the state in the\nDOM can diverge from the state in your `Model` while waiting on the next\n`requestAnimationFrame` call. So updating the DOM synchronously makes this\ndivergence impossible.\n\n[sp]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation\n[pd]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault\n[passive]: https://github.com/WICG/EventListenerOptions/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md\n",
